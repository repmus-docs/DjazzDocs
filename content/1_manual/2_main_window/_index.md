3. Clear the current song.
4. Select a preloaded song from the dropdown menu.

![data view](images/data-view.png)
1. **BEATS**: total number of beats in the song 
2. **SECTION**: whether section is looped, and number of beats in current section
3. **TEMPO**: current tempo. Note: if the [beat input] comes from [Djazz's metronome](2_beat_window_selector#metronome) or a [remote metronome](2_beat_window_selector#remote), this will not change. If the beat input is [manual](2_beat_window_selector#manual), or if the remote source is a manual tap, this may fluctuate.
4. **BEAT** Number of current beat playing
5. **LABEL** Label of current beat playing, according to the loaded [song file](#3-song-selector)
