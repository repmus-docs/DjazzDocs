Djazz comes with many preloaded songs, but you can also load your own songs to play and improvise on.
To do this, you need to make two files: a [_song file_](make_song_file/index.md) and a [_score file_](make_score_file/index.md). This section contains instructions on the two included tools that let you create these files.
