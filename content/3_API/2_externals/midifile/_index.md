This is a small C application that is called from the shell in the {{< abstref "djazz.make_score_file" >}}make-score-file{{< /abstref >}} tool.  It converts MIDI data to a .txt file, which is then converted by the tool into JSON.

The source code is [available here](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/midifile).
