    "content": " Dynamic creation and destruction of objects: arrays and dicts Hierarchies Saving and reloading architecture Objects in djazz can be created and destroyed, so you can set up variable numbers of different types of players, and different midi and audio outputs. The resulting configurations can then be saved and reloaded.\nThere are two data structures for saving objects: dictionaries and arrays, because some objects occur as ordered sets [midi tracks, effects], while others don’t (players, although they could).\nOrdered sets are placed in arrays using javascript. This way they can be addressed using their indices in the array, and array operations can be used to keep track and change them.\nIn javascript you can make arrays of objects. To delete them, you have to both remove them from the patcher and remove them from the array or you will get undefined stuff.\nThe midi out bank is an example of a hierarchy of objects containing arrays. The bank contains tracks, and the tracks contain (among other things) midi effects. Tracks can be created and deleted, and so can effects. [SLIDE: tree] In addition, there are effects that apply to groups of tracks.\nBANK TRACK GROUP TRACK EFFECT_LIST EFFECT\nTo make this structure:\nEach object in the hierarchy contains a javascript object with the variable name « components, » which is responsible for creating, deleting, and dispatching messages to, and gathering data from the hierarchy objects it contains.\nEach « component » object contains an array of objects. [SLIDE]\nWhen objects are created, they are also placed in the array.\nThe code in each of these component objects is similar, and they could be abstracted into classes (prototypes) that components are derived from, if this method seems important enough to do that.\nThe bank can be saved as a dictionary.\nDictionary entries can be dictionaries and arrays, and array entries can be dictionaries and arrays. The midi bank dictionary contains arrays which contain dictionaries which contain arrays. Arbitrary nesting of dictionaries and arrays is possible. Access and modification becomes complicated, which I’ll talk about in section 4.\nTo save a midi bank layout:\nJavascript objects can declare attributes: values that can be accessed like normal max objects. Attributes can be dictionaries. Attribute values can also have custom getters and setters, which means that the attribute value does not have be something actually stored. A getter can dynamically construct it when it is invoked, and a setter can do something other than save the given value.\nThe midi bank thus has an attribute « bank_dict » that, when queried, builds a dictionary from its components’ data. It writes an array of its tracks, calling each of its tracks to give it the required data for its given array index. It calls each track by requesting a dict attribute from the track representing its components. The track builds a dict in the same way, calling its effect components. This process continues until a recursively-built dictionary is completed, then the midi bank passes it to the caller which writes it as a json file.\nTo reload the midi bank, the opposite occurs: the attribute value setter builds the track list by creating each track and then sending it the corresponding track dict so that it can build itself.\nThe actual dict values are at no time saved.\n[EXAMPLE]\nThis can be applied to the entire architecture of a session, including all the players. It will be once we’ve worked out what all the players will be and how they will be arranged.\nBecause of the hierarchical arrangement of dictionaries, the midi bank can have its own set of presets that can be loaded and saved inside the preset of an entire session.\nTo load an entire session including the pattr presets, the architecture dictionary has to be loaded first, and then the preset file.\nBoth the model and the view contain these component objects. Communication between the view and model is in the rightmost wire. Building from these dicts in the model and the view treat the dict like a model, and the model and view become its views.\nCommunication between the control and model during construction must be handled carefully and I’m interested in how to do it better. Originally I thought it would be great to include the dict attributes in the pattr system. Then they could be controlled in the same way that the rest of the parameters are controlled. The problem is this. [SLIDE] Javascript operates on a different (low-priority) thread than Max objects. When it calls Max to creat an object (new default), it passes control to this thread and continues to the next javascript command—we don’t know when the max command will finish in relation to the javascript. As components in the view hierarchy are built, we can’t assume that their analogs in the model are built at the same time. Thus messages cannot be passed from one to the other. Thus we cannot count on the pattr system working when the hierarchies are constructed. It has to use a different system.\nCreating effects: to create a midi effect, several easy standards must be met: MIDI notes follow a given value (list of numbers) MIDI comes in the left inlet and out the left inlet A control/view and a model patch Communication btw control and model occur via pattr, so pattrs with the same name (possibly hierarchic) must exist in both patches Control and model patchers must be put in appropriately named subfolders of a folder titled by the effect name.\nIf you do this, the effect will show up in the effect list. This gives an easy, max-less way for developers to add their own effects.",

    "content": "Djazz uses a song file to play a song, whether you are plaing back scores or using live MIDI or audio. A song file is not a score file. It does not contain any notes to play. Where a score file contains the notes in each beat of the song, a song file contains all the metadata for each beat: its label, its position in the song, and what chapter of the song it is in, in order to make the grid and send the master clock and factor oracle the appropriate data. Djazz uses labels that represent chords. In this way, a song file is like a chord chart.\nTo create a song file for a new song you want to play with Djazz, the make_song_file Max patcher is provided for you in the tools folder.\nSONG NAME Enter the name of the given song; this will be displayed when the song file is loaded, and will also appear in the song dropdown menu if it is placed in the djazz_user/scores/ folder\nBEATS Enter here the total number of beats in the song.\nTEMPO Enter the song tempo. This tempo will be loaded into Djazz’s metronome when the song is loaded, and is also the tempo that will be expected if manual tap entry is performed\nTIME SIGNATURE Enter the number of beats per measure, i.e. the top number in the time signature. The duration of the beats, i.e. the bottom number in the time signature (4 for quarter note, 8 for eighth note, etc.) does not matter; do not include it.\nCHAPTER START BARS If the song is divided into chapters, enter here the bar (i.e. measure) numbers at which the chapters begin. For instance, if a song contains four chapters of 16, 16, 32, and 64 bars, in that order, the chapter start bars will be 1, 17, 33, and 65. Enter these numbers without commas\nPutting all this together, here’s what you would enter for a song in 4/4 time, with chapters of duration as above: 16, 16, 32, and 32 bars. The number of beats is the total number of bars multiplied by the time signature; in this case (16 + 16 + 32 + 64) * 4 = 128 * 4 = 516\nBEAT LABELS Beat labels are input in a text-based format. They can be entered directly into the tool’s window, or cut and pasted from a text editor.\nA chord label has two parts, the root and the quality. The way of entering labels is as follows:\n(\u003c chord root \u003e \u003c chord quality \u003e \u003c number of consecutive beats \u003e)\n\u003c chord root \u003e can be the symbol C, C#, Db, D, D#, Eb, E, F, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab, A, A#, Bb, or B.\n\u003c chord quality \u003e can be any symbol that does not contain an underscore (\"_\") or a semicolon(\";\").\nThe improvisation algorithm functions in part by matching these symbols with the symbols on the beats in score files, so if you want it to work correctly, keep the format of these symbols the same. For instance, the preloaded songs in Djazz use the following symbols:\nmaj7, min7, 7, dim7, maj6, min6\nBut you can define any symbols you want:\ndom7#9b9#11, maj6add9, min6withanextraweirdnoteatthetop, etc.\n\u003c number of consecutive beats \u003e is how many beats this particular label is repeated.\nSo for instance, the chord sequence\nAmaj7 Amaj7 Dmin7 Amaj7\nAmaj7 Dmin7 E7 Amaj7\nwould be entered as\nIt could also be entered as\nif this is easier to read.\nIndentation and carriage returns are ignored by the tool.\nMAKING A SONG FILE In summary, to make a new song file, follow the seven steps listed below.\nOpen the patcher “djazz.make_song_file.maxpat” from the folder “patchers/data_conversion_tools” in the current djazz folder.\nIn the appropriate fields, put in the song name, beat count, tempo, time signature, and the starting bars for each chapter.\nFill in the “Beat Labels” box.\nPress the “save” button.\nSave the song file in the folder of the same song name that contains the subfolders “new” and “new2.” The file name and the song folder name should be exactly the same.\nThat’s all. If you put the song file in a folder with scores in “new” and “new2” subfolders , this song can now be played as usual by Djazz.\nPress the “clear” button to clear the data.",

When objects containing parameters are created (like midi tracks), new parameters are created.\nTwo javascript objects then allow for device connection. The ParameterInfoProvider lists all the parameters, and alerts us when parameters are added or removed.\nA javascript object contains a parameterInfoProvider and an array of ParameterListeners. Each time a parameter is added, a parameter listener is created for it.\nThis javascript object centralises parameter communication. When a parameter is changed, it sends out its name and value. It receives values too. Essentially it’s a replica of the pattrstorage object. Why use it? Because the parameters are mapped to our control surface, not the model. We can take into account the control object logic; several buttons that change the same pattr can be saved as different parameters. Then we have more than one typed interface to the variable: we can control it as a toggle, or an int. For instance, the loop variable can be controlled by buttons with a launchpad, and by the number box with the ring. All you need to do is expose the desired control type and set is as a parameter. Again, the underlying model is unaffected.\nParameter listener and maxobjlisteners are hard to deal with because you can’t delete them.",

The factor oracle algorithm can be modified with pattern-matching methods. The input to the factor oracle come from scores and real-time input, either audio or MIDI, and is output as audio or MIDI. It uses Antescofo to generate notes both from scores and generated as improvisations in tempo.\nDjazz improvises on songs using template files, which are lists of beats with labels representing positions in the songs. Notes are in different files: scores and audio tags in the databases used by the factor oracle.\nThe song templates pass the label to the factor oracle know given time. For songs whose formal structure includes verses or sections, this larger structure is also included in the template. It can also improvise over a “free” structure by using a trivial template, just a short list of beats that loops.\nDjazz is played by inputting a tap—manually, from a built-in metronome, or from another application. The tap triggers a beat, which triggers notes to be output from the factor oracle or the score, which triggers note data to be output from antescofo, which triggers sound to be output by the audio or midi outputs. [SLIDE]\nYou can see this control flow. The tap comes in on the left and comes out as sound from the midi bank on the right. The intermediate translations from tap to beat occur in the objects along the way. The architecture: several players which function independently. There is a master control for synchronising timing and for broadcasting global commands.",

(« VIEW »)\nA device-specific color code file\ntde color-code file is imported into tde database accessor files tdat are common to Launchpads.\ntde database accessor files exist to translate between tde formats of tde various dicts.\ntde structure for each of tdese dicts can be done in different ways. Some criteria exist:\ntde user-created dict must be easy to create, eitder by editing tde text or witd a max object\ntde program-read dicts must be efficient, easily read by tde program.\ntdese two criteria are different and ask for different structures. Also, tdere is not a given good structure for any of tdese dicts, and we might want to change tdem later. We might even have to, as new launchpads, and new devices, use different formats.\nSo tdere’s not a general metdod for structuring tdese dicts. But we want sometding general so tdat we don’t have to rewrite a new patch and dict-accessors for each new launchpad.\nTo solve tdis, we create dict-readers and dict-writers, two types of javascript objects. Each one exports a set of metdods tdat access data or modify data. tde implementation of tde metdods are hidden to tde user. Each one is specific to tde context it acts in. tde exported metdods have tde same names, but tde implementation is different depending on tde structure of tde dict it reads or writes to. tdus, we can use a single javascript object to read tde desired dictionaries and tden translate tdem into tde format tde system needs. Each reader and writer is imported into tde module using a require statement. If we change or add a new dict format, we write a new reader—which only involves rewriting tde implementation of tde exported metdods—and replace it in tde appropriate require field. tdese can also be jsarguments. tdis way, we have translators: objects tdat take a reader and a writer.\nDictionaries in Javascript and pure Max Gotchas",

    "content": "Input is passed to patchers two ways: synchronously and asynchronously, depending on the type of input data. Synchoronous data consists of the beat number, the current tempo (since this can fluctuate), and any data to be used by the analyzer. This data is passed serially through patch cords which send data serially.\nAsynchoronous data is anything changed by the user using the GUI. A lot of this data is well known to audio interface users: track volume, MIDI and audio effects like pitch transposition, for instance.\nPattr translation in control and view control\nInterface - not much to say. Just graphical controls. Sends and receives pattrs to and from control. Infinite loop is avoided via pattrstorage output mode set to 5.\nThe CONTROL PATTRS and DATA PATTRS (dicts) are saved. On loading, the data pattrs must be fully loaded first; their priorities are set to 1. The control pattrs are independent so their priorities are all 0.\nEvery parameter is stored in a pattr object.\nAs an example, here is a midi player object, which contains, among other components, a beat clock. The beat clock itself contains several components. Here we see one of them, « loop_section » and the pattr objects it contains. [SLIDE]\nThe pattrhub object invokes them, so a message “step 2” will set the step pattr object in beat_clock to 2.\nPattrs act hierarchically. The beat clock is named “beat_clock” [SLIDE], so the step variable can be invoked by sending the beat clock the message “beat_clock::step 2.” This double-colon format continues as the pattr object is nested in deeper levels of a hierarchy.\nThe control consists of bpatchers. No bpatchers are in the model. These handle all the user interface logic like buttons and file selection. To change a parameter in the model, a pattr object must exist in the view with the same name as the corresponding one in the model. These names don’t conflict because they are in different sub patchers.\nA pattrstorage object in the control keeps track of pattern changes. When the outputmode attribute is non-zero, it will send the names and values of changed parameters out its outlet. Hence, to communicate parameter changes to the model, the pattrstorage output is sent out the control and into a pattrthub object at the top level of the model, which then broadcasts the changes to the proper places.\nNote: with this method, the interior pattrhub objects end up not being used at all, but it’s still good to leave them in so that these objects can be reused and are not dependent on being called this way.\nThe hierarchical nature of the model, though, means that the parameter names sent from the control must have the same hierarchical structure as those in the model. Thus to control the “midi_player_1::beat_clock::loop_length” parameter, there must be a control bpatcher called “midi_player_1” that contains a bpatcher “beat_clock” that contains a pattr “loop_length.”\nFor smaller systems, this could be a good method: the control and the model are parallel hierarchies. There are three problems with this method, though. The separation of model and control is supposed to give you the freedom to design the control without worrying about how things are being processed inside the model.\nThe control architecture is completely linked to the model architecture, which becomes very constraining, especially as the control logic in a complicated system probably does not reflect the way things are processed.\nYou don’t necessarily want to control all the pattrs in the model. Some you might find unnecessary. This is not a big problem, but there is another related one:\nSome pattrs in the model are not actually independent of each other at runtime. Objects were created independently, but their functions in the system are dependent on each other or other objects\nIt’s useful to design objects by thinking of their function independently of other objects, even though in the system they will not be independent.\nFor example:\nThere is an object that outputs a given number of bangs at a given tempo: it has two pattrs, “tempo” and “count”: the number of bangs to output.\nThere is another object that changes the system tempo.\nThe tempo object can be used to adjust the tempo by itself. But it is also used to control a parameter called “speed.” Speed makes the musical output play twice as fast (double time), or in triplets, etc. Changing the speed to two means both doubling the tempo and setting the number of bangs to two.\nThus the mapping from control pattrs to model pattrs is not one-to-one. We can imagine more complicated networks of dependencies among model parameters that we don’t want to reflect in the control.\nIt’s useful to design these two objects separately because they can then be tested and maybe reused later. We end up with a model that is “feature-rich,” and the job is now to decide which features we want to use, and how they will be reflected in the control.\nNote: In terms of domain-driven design, it’s important not to spend too much time building objects that do lots of things that we may not ultimately care about using. We’re not building a library, we’re building an application. On the other hand, building separate small objects that handle specific independent functions is a useful way to make building blocks for our application. So there’s a trade-off: designing for the application with an eye for the kind of independent and reusable objects that will make up a library.\nTo address these three problems, Djazz uses the following method:\nFor each important object that is made up of smaller components containing pattrs, like the “midi player,” there is a parameter bank. [SLIDE] This bank consists only of the surface pattrs that the control will call.\nThe midi player and the parameter bank are wrapped in a larger object, and parameters from the bank are passed to the midi player through a translator object.\nThis translator handles the three problems above. It translates the surface parameters to their corresponding hierarchically named pattrs, which is very easy. In this object, too, are placed the objects that translate control variables into dependent model variables, like f(speed)—\u003e[bang_count, tempo]. Finally, unused variables simply aren’t called. But to be absolutely sure that uncalled variables don’t give us trouble, by storing state that have forgotten about, or by accidentally being called, due to sharing names accidentally with a control variable, we can turn off their visibility to the pattrstorage system, which means they can never be called. There is a javascript object I wrote which will turn off all the pattrs in an object. The first argument tells it what the visibility is, the second weather to recursively change the visibility in sub patchers. [EXAMPLE]\nNow, in the control bpatcher, there is a similar parameter bank. Now the architectures of the control and the model are separate, and we are free to design the control as we want. As long as our controls send a message to the parameter bank with the right name, it will be sent to the model. [SLIDE] Now we can set up the controls as we like, and all the control logic—button operation, etc.—is completely independent of anything that happens in the model, and vice versa. Because the pattrstorage object is inside the view, the namespace “view” is not included in parameter names.\nThe model outputs midi and audio, but it also outputs pattrs to any view that wants to receive them. It does this the same way as the control: a pattrstorage object is at the top level of the model patcher, and when a pattr value is updated, it outputs the pattr name and value. There are two types of pattrs that the model outputs: those that are specifically for a view, and the parameters that were sent from the control. [SLIDE] Because the control is the view, this flow of pattrs becomes a loop. [SLIDE] The control/view pattrstorage sends values to the model’s pattrhub, and the model pattrstorage send values to the control/view’s pattrhub\nTo avoid an infinite loop, we make use the pattrstorage’s outputmode attribute.\nIn the model, the output mode is 2: any changed values are sent out. But in the view, the output mode is 6: values that are changed by objects in the pattr system are not sent out. That is, only values that are changed by user interaction are sent out. Thus the values received by pattrhub are set but not passed on. The loop is broken. [SLIDE]\nThe control flow is clear All of the state is centralised in the parameter banks The state can be read in in real time by the client windows (easy to debug) The state can be saved as preset files and reloaded.",

    "content": "The generator uses the beat number when improvise mode is not on; it uses this to play the next beat or a different beat if one has been selected by the user. In improvise mode, the beat number is not considered. The label produced by the analyzer is used, as described above.\nThe beat generator can play in two modes: score player and improviser. Each of these also contain two modes: play at the tempo given by the tap, or play at a different speed: double speed, quadruple speed, half speed, and one and a half speed. This speed change is controlled by an object–the “Speed Control” that, when messages are passed to the generator, modifies the timing of their distribution to the generator’s internal objects. Even though both the score player and the improviser use the Speed Control, the result is different, because the Score Player receives beat number messages and the Improviser receives beat label messages.\nThe Score Player contains two subpatchers, a “Master Clock Follower” and an “Internal Clock Follower.” In Score Player mode, if the Speed Control is active, beat numbers are sent to the Internal Clock Follower, which outputs beat numbers at a different tempo than the input tap. The musical result is an interesting version of “playing out:” beats are played at a different rate, meaning their internal harmony, given by each beat’s chord label, no longer aligns with that of the other tracks:\nMaster Clock Input: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Internal Clock Follower Output: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 The Internal Clock Follower contains its own Beat Clock object. It is passed the same asynchronous messages as the Master Beat Clock, concerning the song beat data like the end beat, the current section beats, and whether the current chapter is being looped. If the Speed Control is inactive, the beat number messages given by the Master Beat Clock are simply passed through.\nIn the Improviser, it is the beat label messages are passed. Beat labels are passed in at the master tempo. When a label is received, it is saved in a message object and a bang is sent to the Speed Control. If active, the speed control at its modified tempo, which trigger the saved label to be passed to the factor oracle player. The result is that the factor oracle player outputs beats that conform to the harmony of the given beat, even though they are at a different tempo:\nMaster Clock Input: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Improviser Output: Am7 Am7 D7 D7 Gmaj7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Cmaj7 The Improviser The factor oracle (“factor_oracle.maxpat”) The factor oracle player creates the improvisation. As its name suggests, it contains and makes use of the “factor_oracle” Max abstraction.\nThe analyzer uses the same set of symbols as the factor oracle. It is used both offline, to create a file of labeled beats for a song, and online, to convert the data at the beginning of each beat into a symbol to be passed to the factor oracle player. This symbol is then used as the query to the factor oracle to produce the next beat.\nThe analyzer Definition:\nA beat is a collection of notes that occurs between two timepoints. These timepoints are considered to occur at regular intervals. Thus a piece of music that has a pulse can be considered a sequence of beats.\nAt each new beat, calculate a new beat’s worth of music to play. The calculation consists of finding a beat in the database that is the “best match” (or at least a “good match”) based on the data that exists at the beginning of the new beat.\nThis data can be based on any of the following:\nThe location in the song/musical piece. For example, “the A minor 7 chord that occurs at the beginning of measure 13.” A good match is a beat from the database that occurs over the same chord. This could be the same beat as in the original piece, or it could be a different beat that has the same chord, which is more interesting. This creates correct adherence to musical form, if such form exists in the piece.\nWhat we just played in the last beat. For example, an ascending scale in the previous beat could look for a melody that starts on the next note in the scale in the next beat. This creates continuity.\nWhat other listeners have played. This creates responsiveness.\nIn the current usage of Djazz, this match is based only on option 1: the chord symbol that occurs on the given beat.\nLabel matching Matching is done by comparing labels. Each beat has a label which reflects the data described above. It is a string of symbols. The nature of this string is determined by the user. In the current usage of Djazz, this string represents the chord symbol, which consists of the chord root and its quality, separated by an underline. Chord roots are numbered from zero to eleven, with zero representing C; thus, C# (or Db) is 1, D is 2, etc. For example, “0_maj7” represents a C major seventh chord.\nA match can be made by exact comparison, or by “fuzzy” methods. In the current usage of Djazz, a chord represents a match if the quality is the same, but the root can be a small distance away from the desired one. The melody is then transposed to match the correct root.\nOffline analysis currently consists of adding the chord labels to each beat. The user inputs this using a graphical tool that takes chord information and stores it in a list of beats; that is, no analysis is done save for copying the “chord chart” into a data file. This data file, which also contains other data like the song tempo, time signature, section starting and ending beats, and song title, is loaded into Djazz when a song is played.\nOnline analysis, as a result, is just a case of reading the chord label from the dictionary when a beat number is generated. This is in fact done by the master clock: it sends out the tempo, chord label, beat number, in immediate succession each time a tap is input.\nThe methods here are general, and the current usage of Djazz can be changed to admit other types of music. This would involve using an extant system, devising a new one, or modifying an extant one to label beats. Optionally defining the definition of a match, if it is not defined as exact.\nThe following criteria must be met: The online analyzer uses the same set of labels as the offline analyzer, if an offline analyzer is used.\nAlso, the architecture is modular, which means that other methods of improvisation are possible. That means that another object can replace the factor oracle player within “improviser” as long as it adheres to the following criteria:\nIt receives a label at the beginning of each beat It produces a beat number, in response to the label, that represents the next beat to play. Example: Song with the same chord for all beats. In the case where all the beat labels are the same, the factor oracle player algorithm will ground out to simply choosing a measure aleatorically.\nIn some cases this could be desired. It is perhaps more interesting, though, to take advantage of the label-matching behavior to create one’s own labels, and thus direct the improvisation.\nFollowing the description of the matching criteria, the first half of the label must be a chord root symbol, but the second half can be anything: it will be matched by exact string matching.\nA song with beats labeled thus:\nE m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 E m7 courld be written as\nE 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 which would always select a measure labelled with a 2 to follow a measure labelled with a 1, a 3 to follow a 2, etc. Like this, formal positions in sections could be preserved.\nE a E f E d E c E a E b E a E b E d E f E c E 4 E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 Djazz supplies a software framework for empirical inquiry into the suitability of a particular data encoding for music: ascertaining the “correctness” of an analysis via listening to the resulting synthesis.",

    "content": " Dynamic creation and destruction of objects: arrays and dicts Hierarchies Saving and reloading architecture Objects in djazz can be created and destroyed, so you can set up variable numbers of different types of players, and different midi and audio outputs. The resulting configurations can then be saved and reloaded.\nThere are two data structures for saving objects: dictionaries and arrays, because some objects occur as ordered sets [midi tracks, effects], while others don’t (players, although they could).\nOrdered sets are placed in arrays using javascript. This way they can be addressed using their indices in the array, and array operations can be used to keep track and change them.\nIn javascript you can make arrays of objects. To delete them, you have to both remove them from the patcher and remove them from the array or you will get undefined stuff.\nThe midi out bank is an example of a hierarchy of objects containing arrays. The bank contains tracks, and the tracks contain (among other things) midi effects. Tracks can be created and deleted, and so can effects. [SLIDE: tree] In addition, there are effects that apply to groups of tracks.\nBANK TRACK GROUP TRACK EFFECT_LIST EFFECT\nTo make this structure:\nEach object in the hierarchy contains a javascript object with the variable name « components, » which is responsible for creating, deleting, and dispatching messages to, and gathering data from the hierarchy objects it contains.\nEach « component » object contains an array of objects. [SLIDE]\nWhen objects are created, they are also placed in the array.\nThe code in each of these component objects is similar, and they could be abstracted into classes (prototypes) that components are derived from, if this method seems important enough to do that.\nThe bank can be saved as a dictionary.\nDictionary entries can be dictionaries and arrays, and array entries can be dictionaries and arrays. The midi bank dictionary contains arrays which contain dictionaries which contain arrays. Arbitrary nesting of dictionaries and arrays is possible. Access and modification becomes complicated, which I’ll talk about in section 4.\nTo save a midi bank layout:\nJavascript objects can declare attributes: values that can be accessed like normal max objects. Attributes can be dictionaries. Attribute values can also have custom getters and setters, which means that the attribute value does not have be something actually stored. A getter can dynamically construct it when it is invoked, and a setter can do something other than save the given value.\nThe midi bank thus has an attribute « bank_dict » that, when queried, builds a dictionary from its components’ data. It writes an array of its tracks, calling each of its tracks to give it the required data for its given array index. It calls each track by requesting a dict attribute from the track representing its components. The track builds a dict in the same way, calling its effect components. This process continues until a recursively-built dictionary is completed, then the midi bank passes it to the caller which writes it as a json file.\nTo reload the midi bank, the opposite occurs: the attribute value setter builds the track list by creating each track and then sending it the corresponding track dict so that it can build itself.\nThe actual dict values are at no time saved.\n[EXAMPLE]\nThis can be applied to the entire architecture of a session, including all the players. It will be once we’ve worked out what all the players will be and how they will be arranged.\nBecause of the hierarchical arrangement of dictionaries, the midi bank can have its own set of presets that can be loaded and saved inside the preset of an entire session.\nTo load an entire session including the pattr presets, the architecture dictionary has to be loaded first, and then the preset file.\nBoth the model and the view contain these component objects. Communication between the view and model is in the rightmost wire. Building from these dicts in the model and the view treat the dict like a model, and the model and view become its views.\nCommunication between the control and model during construction must be handled carefully and I’m interested in how to do it better. Originally I thought it would be great to include the dict attributes in the pattr system. Then they could be controlled in the same way that the rest of the parameters are controlled. The problem is this. [SLIDE] Javascript operates on a different (low-priority) thread than Max objects. When it calls Max to creat an object (new default), it passes control to this thread and continues to the next javascript command—we don’t know when the max command will finish in relation to the javascript. As components in the view hierarchy are built, we can’t assume that their analogs in the model are built at the same time. Thus messages cannot be passed from one to the other. Thus we cannot count on the pattr system working when the hierarchies are constructed. It has to use a different system.\nCreating effects: to create a midi effect, several easy standards must be met: MIDI notes follow a given value (list of numbers) MIDI comes in the left inlet and out the left inlet A control/view and a model patch Communication btw control and model occur via pattr, so pattrs with the same name (possibly hierarchic) must exist in both patches Control and model patchers must be put in appropriately named subfolders of a folder titled by the effect name.\nIf you do this, the effect will show up in the effect list. This gives an easy, max-less way for developers to add their own effects.",

    "content": "Each track or score can be played in improvise mode or not, by selecting or deselecting the “jam” button.\nWhen not in improvise mode–we’ll call this play mode–the beats will be played one after the other as they were written/recorded in the loaded tracks. In improvise mode, at each new beat, Djazz calculates a new beat’s worth of music to play. The calculation consists of finding a beat in the database that is the “best match” (or at least a “good match”) based on the data that exists at the beginning of the new beat. The selection is made using a data structure called a factor oracle.\nIn play mode, Djazz uses the beat number to calculate the next beat. In improvise mode, the beat number is not considered; the chord label from the song file is used.In each of these two modes changing the speed control will make play at the tempo given by the tap or play at a different speed: double speed, quadruple speed, half speed, and one and a half speed. The result is different, because play mode uses beat number messages and improvise mode uses beat label messages.\nIn play mode, if the Speed Control is active, beat numbers are output at a different tempo than the input tap. The musical result is an interesting version of “playing out:” beats are played at a different rate, meaning their internal harmony, given by each beat’s chord label, no longer aligns with that of the other tracks:\nMaster Clock Input: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Internal Clock Follower Output: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 In improvise mode, with the speed control on, labels are still passed in at the original tempo. The result is that the improviser outputs beats that conform to the harmony of the given beat, even though they are at a different tempo:\nMaster Clock Input: Am7 D7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Improviser Output: Am7 Am7 D7 D7 Gmaj7 Gmaj7 Cmaj7 Cmaj7 ",

L’un des grands enjeux de sa réécriture est de lui donner une conception suffisamment modulaire pour pouvoir modifier facilement le style musical ainsi que l’algorithme de calcul des improvisations.\nFeatures Installation \u0026 Usage Djazz needs no special installation.
